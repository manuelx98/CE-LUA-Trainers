# CE-LUA-Trainers

Just a bunch of LUA scripts I put together to use with their respective Cheat Engine tables.

These scripts can be compiled using Cheat Engine to make custom Trainers to use with a game, without the need to open CE every time.

All resulting trainers (except when specified) are background processes without UI that can be opened with the game, perform their specific actions and close down when the game is closed.

Disclaimer: As every Cheat Engine-thing, any antivirus can detect the compiled exe as a virus, which is not.
The tables I use are not made by me, I just post my scripts for posterity and myself.



## Building

1. Install Cheat Engine (https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)
2. Download the CE table for the game you want to use from the links below
3. Open Cheat Engine and the table you just downloaded
4. Press Ctrl+Alt +L or "Table->Show Cheat Table LUA Script"
5. Paste my code, then File->Save As->.Exe
6. Trainer Size -> Gigantic (to use it without CE)
7. Process -> Target is 32/64-bit (depends on the game)
8. Change EXE Icon -> Select the game's exe
9. Press Generate
10. Enjoy
